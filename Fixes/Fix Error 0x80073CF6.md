## Solution

**1. Ensure the partition/drive you are installing from is NTFS**

**2. Redownload WSA Build .zip (sometime the files can be corrupted during download and extraction)**

**3. Delete all folders containing "WindowsSubsystemForAndroid" in the following directories/paths:** 

<br>

   - *C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\AppRepository*
   
   - *C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsApps*
   
   - *%localappdata\ProgramData\Packages*

<br>

**4. Restart your Computer**

<br>

**Hope this works for you!**
