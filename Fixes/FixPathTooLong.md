## Issue: </br> Error stating that "Path is too long" when extracting files from .zip archive, needed to install Windows Subystem for Android (WSA)
### Preface:
##### This issue is caused if the folder name is too long. This is the typically the case as MagiskOnWSALocal script tends to generate a long string for the .zip file and the folder within the archive.
