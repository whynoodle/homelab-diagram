## Guide: Moving/Installing Windows Subsystem For Android™ (WSA) to another partition or disk 

### Preface:
##### WSA can take up a lot of storage space, hence you want to move it to another partition or disk with more space. <br> This guide goes through a method by which you can install WSA from another disk and to store the data in that drive (instead of "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_8wekyb3d8bbwe").
