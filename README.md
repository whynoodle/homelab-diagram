|**We would like to say one thing: We respect the Terms and Conditions set out by Github to its users. MagiskOnWSA Builds are built using the MagiskOnWSALocal script, patched in the case of Windows 10 Builds and uploaded onto Github and hence do not rely on the use of Github Actions.**|

> ### :exclamation: **Important:**
>  ### Prebuilt Windows Subsystem For Android™ Builds for Windows™ 11 in [Releases](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/releases) HAVE NOT been modified in anyway prior and subsequent to running the MagiskOnWSA script and upload to Github. 
> ### Prebuilt Windows Subsystem For Android™ Builds for Windows™ 10 in [Releases](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/releases) ONLY have had AppxManifest.xml, icu.dll and WsaPatch.dll patched according to the WSAPatch guide before upload to Github.

> ### I will move to a more transparent method of building MagiskOnWSA builds soon, due to the overarching concerns with safety, transparancy and build integrity

> #### The same level of scrutiny should be applied with the Windows Subsystem For Android™ builds as with any other program that you download from the internet
