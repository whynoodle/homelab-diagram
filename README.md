> ### Prebuilt Windows Subsystem For Android™ Builds for Windows™ 10 in [Releases](https://github.com/MustardChef/WSABuilds/releases) ONLY have had AppxManifest.xml, icu.dll and WsaPatch.dll patched according to the WSAPatch guide before upload to Github.

> ### I will move to a more transparent method of building MagiskOnWSA builds soon, due to the overarching concerns with safety, transparancy and build integrity

> #### The same level of scrutiny should be applied with the Windows Subsystem For Android™ builds as with any other program that you download from the internet
